# Research-Paper---BIG-DATA-IN-TESLA-VEHICLES-AND-THE-INTERNET-OF-VEHICLES-IOV-

Abstract:
The possibility of highly automated vehicles on every route appears to be growing. The
demand for self-driving car research has never been higher, with businesses like Tesla, Google,
BMW, and others vying to develop a completely autonomous vehicle. Modern automobiles are
expected to be connected through heterogeneous radio access technologies and be able to share
huge amounts of data with their surroundings due to the rapid growth of automotive telematics.
Traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are developing to the Internet of Vehicles
(IoV), which offers an efficient and intelligent future transportation system by dramatically
expanding network scale and conducting both real-time and long-term information processing.
Automated vehicles, on the other hand, not only consume but also generate large amounts of data
known as big data. Furthermore, this data is generated processed, and stored for its future use.
